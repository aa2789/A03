## Glossary
* <b>Branch</b>- A branch is a copy of a repository. It is contained within the repository but does not affect the master branch. This allows for the ability to work without disrupting the live version. After changes in the branch have been made, it can be merged with the master branch to publish the changes.

* <b>Clone</b>- Cloning a repository means you create a local copy of a repository. This allows for edits to be be made locally instead of directly in the source files of the original repository.

* <b>Commit</b>-A commit is an individual change to a file. When a commit is made, Git creates a specific ID that allows you to keep track of the specific changes made and when.

* <b>Fetch</b>- Git Fetch is the primary command used to download contents from a remote repository.

* <b>GIT</b>- GIT is an open source distributed version control system that ensures that there are no code conflicts between developers. GIT stores code and  allows developers to revert and go back to an older version of the code when needed.

* <b>Github</b>- Github is a repository hosting service. While GIT is a command line tool, Github offers a web based graphical interface which allows for many collaboration features.

* <b>Merge</b>- Merging takes the changes from one branch and applies them into another. This often happens through a pull request.

* <b>Merge Conflict</b>- A merge conflict occurs when people make changes to the same line of a file or when one person deletes a file and another person edits it. Merge conflicts must be resolved before merging occurs.

* <b>Push</b>-Push means to send committed changes to a remote repository on Github.com.

* <b>Pull</b>-Pull refers to when you fetch changes but also merge them.

* <b>Remote</b>-is the version of a repository or branch that is hosted on a server.

* <b> Repository</b>-a repository is like a project's folder, which contains all of the project's files. Repositories can have multiple collaborators and can be either public or private.
