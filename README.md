## Directions for using Git/Webstorm/Github
<h3>Git and Github</h3>
<p> <b>GitHub</b> is the single largest host for Git repositories. In order to se it up, you simply have to create a new account. <b>Git</b> is a version control system that ensures there is no code conflicts between developers. To begin using git, you need to fist install it and make a github account.
  When creating a new project on Git, you need to first create a new <b>repository</b>. Once a file has been added to the project, it can be edited and the changes can be saved using the <b>commit</b> command. If you don't want to finalize changes to your main project, you can <b>branch</b> the project. Branches allow you to move back and forth between states of a project. <b> Cloning</b> is also a way to make edits without affecting the final version. Once you're satisfied with the changes made, you can <b> merge</b> the changes into the primary branch. Using the <b> push</b> command allows other people
  to see the changes that have been made. A <b> pull</b> request is a way to alert a repository's owner that you want to make some changes to their code.
</p>
<h3> Webstorm</h3>
<p>Webstorm is a popular IDE for modern javascript development. It provides full support for javascript, html and css. In order to connect github with Webstorm, 
go to system preferences, select Version Control Git and enter the path to the git.exe file. In order to import a repository from Github, select checkout from version control
and choose git.After making changes on webstorm, you can commit the changes and push changes to the github repository, which will add the file to github.

## Glossary
* <b>Branch</b>- A branch is a copy of a repository. It is contained within the repository but does not affect the master branch. This allows for the ability to work without disrupting the live version. After changes in the branch have been made, it can be merged with the master branch to publish the changes.

* <b>Clone</b>- Cloning a repository means you create a local copy of a repository. This allows for edits to be be made locally instead of directly in the source files of the original repository.

* <b>Commit</b>-A commit is an individual change to a file. When a commit is made, Git creates a specific ID that allows you to keep track of the specific changes made and when.

* <b>Fetch</b>- Git Fetch is the primary command used to download contents from a remote repository.

* <b>GIT</b>- GIT is an open source distributed version control system that ensures that there are no code conflicts between developers. GIT stores code and  allows developers to revert and go back to an older version of the code when needed.

* <b>Github</b>- Github is a repository hosting service. While GIT is a command line tool, Github offers a web based graphical interface which allows for many collaboration features.

* <b>Merge</b>- Merging takes the changes from one branch and applies them into another. This often happens through a pull request.

* <b>Merge Conflict</b>- A merge conflict occurs when people make changes to the same line of a file or when one person deletes a file and another person edits it. Merge conflicts must be resolved before merging occurs.

* <b>Push</b>-Push means to send committed changes to a remote repository on Github.com.

* <b>Pull</b>-Pull refers to when you fetch changes but also merge them.

* <b>Remote</b>-is the version of a repository or branch that is hosted on a server.

* <b> Repository</b>-a repository is like a project's folder, which contains all of the project's files. Repositories can have multiple collaborators and can be either public or private.
